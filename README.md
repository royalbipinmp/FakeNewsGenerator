# Fake News Headline Generator

This is a simple and fun Python script that generates completely random and ridiculous fake news headlines. It's meant purely for entertainment — don't take it seriously!

## What It Does

Every time you run the script, it randomly picks:

- A subject (like a celebrity, politician, or animal)
- An action (like "eats" or "declares war on")
- A place or thing (like "a plate of samosa" or "at Red Fort")

Then it combines them into a fake headline like:

BREAKINGNEWS: Shahrukh Khan eats a plate of samosa

## Purpose

This script is made just for fun. It's a humorous way to practice Python basics like using lists, the `random` module, and loops. 

**Note:** This does NOT generate real news. It’s all fake and meant as a joke.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Copy the code into a file named `fake_news_generator.py`.
3. Run it using:

   python fake_news_generator.py

4. The script will show a random headline.
5. It will ask if you want another one — type `yes` to continue or `no` to quit.

## Example Output

BREAKINGNEWS: Prime Minister Modi dances with a plate of samosa  
BREAKINGNEWS: A Mumbai Cat celebrates at India Gate  
BREAKINGNEWS: Nirmala Sitharaman cancels inside parliament

## License

Free to use, modify, and share. Just don’t use it to spread actual fake news.

Have fun!
